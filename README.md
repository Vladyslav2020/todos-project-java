I have developed full-stack application for everyday tasks. 
The app allows users to register and add, delete or edit tasks. 
Each task has a creation date and a status that determines whether it is completed or not. All data is stored in a database.

## Tools and technologies
### Java Spring Framework, MySQL JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Redux.
